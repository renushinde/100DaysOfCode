This is my first project for 100daysofcode. I had fun creating this site from scratch. I've used Html, CSS and JavaScript for this project. 
The main focus was to make this site responsive, for which I used CSS grid and Flexbox. Next time, I'll remember to prototype/design first and then start to code.
